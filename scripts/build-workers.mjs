/**
 * Standalone worker bundles — the escape hatch from inlining.
 *
 * `dist/` inlines the worker as a Blob, which requires `worker-src blob:` in the consumer's content
 * security policy. A consumer that cannot grant it serves these files instead and registers a
 * URL-based factory, which takes precedence over the inlined default.
 *
 * Each worker is bundled separately because IIFE output cannot be code-split, and self-contained
 * because a worker resolves no bare specifiers of its own.
