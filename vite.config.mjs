/**
 * Library build — emits the ESM `dist/` that every consumer imports.
 *
 * Module structure is preserved one-to-one with `src/`, so a consumer's bundler can still
 * tree-shake at module granularity. Type declarations are emitted separately by `build:types`;
 * this build emits JavaScript only.
 *
 * The worker is inlined here rather than left for the consumer to resolve. Publishing an
 * unresolved `new Worker(new URL(…, import.meta.url))` hands the decision to whichever bundler runs
 * last, and they do not agree: Rollup rewrites it to an emitted chunk, Rolldown substitutes an
 * empty object for `import.meta` and the construct throws at runtime.
